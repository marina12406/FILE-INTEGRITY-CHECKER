A File Integrity Checker is a crucial tool in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, designed to ensure that files have not been altered or tampered with. It works by generating cryptographic hashes of files and comparing these hashes over time to detect any changes1. Here's a brief overview:

How It Works
Hash Generation: The tool calculates a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the original file. This hash acts as a unique digital fingerprint for the file1.

Baseline Creation: The initial hash values are stored securely as a baseline for future comparisons.

Periodic Checks: The tool periodically recalculates the hash values of the monitored files and compares them with the stored baseline.

Change Detection: If the new hash differs from the baseline, the tool flags the file as modified, indicating potential tampering or corruption.

OUTPUT:
